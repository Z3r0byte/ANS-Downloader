## FAQ
**Does this work on Chromium based browsers as well?**\
No, but I'm pretty sure you can just copy the code into a Chromium extension skeleton.

**Can I have feature X?**\
Only if you make it yourself. I'll happily accept Pull Requests.

**Are you going to steal my ANS session cookie?**\
Absolutely. After putting in the effort I at least want to have a laugh viewing your test results.

**Is this legal?**\
I hope so.
